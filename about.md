I'm a marketer and armchair economist based in Barcelona. Purveyor of dubious takes. I like hamburgers and building nice websites. Together with friends I work on [Strom](https://janbalanya.com/strom-docs/).

You can find me on [LinkedIN](https://linkedin.com/in/jan-balanya-scholl) or check out my [CV](/cv).
