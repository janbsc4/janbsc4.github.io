title: "How to Follow a Blog"
---
Blogs are pretty much the best thing ever. There are blogs full of insights and original takes and blogs linking to interesting parts of the internet. I have [a couple favorite blogs listed below](#blog-recommendations), that I personally enjoy. But, how does one follow a blog?

On some blogs, you can leave your email address and they will email you all their new posts. I find that inconvenient, because the mail inbox gets flooded with emails. Another way to follow a blog is on social media, if they are on social media. But that’s inconvenient for other reasons.[^1]

There is an extremely convenient and simple way to follow most blogs. It’s an old technology called RSS. With a RSS reader app, you can follow most blogs (including all blogs on Substack, Medium, Bluesky and Mastodon).

A good RSS reader for Apple devices is [NetNewsWire](https://netnewswire.com). With NetNewsWire installed, following a new blog is as simple as sharing the webpage of the blog to NetNewsWire from your browser.

Alternatively, clicking the RSS symbol (if they have one) does the same thing.

It really is that simple. You then have a chronological, high-quality feed of the authors you enjoy reading. You can also enable iCloud sync in the settings to have the same feed available on multiple devices. And I haven't tested it, but [Feedly News Reader](https://feedly.com/news-reader) might be a good alternative on Android and the web.

## Blog Recommendations
These are some of the blogs I love reading.

- [Marginal Revolution](https://marginalrevolution.com): Written by two economists, this is a blog <ins>broadly</ins> about economics. A great source of interesting articles and studies.
- [Daring Fireball](https://daringfireball.net): Technology blog with a focus on Apple by John Gruber, the inventor of Markdown. His takes are always well thought-through and measured.
- [Space-Biff](https://spacebiff.com/): I can't even begin to imagine how hard it must be to write entertaining reviews for boardgames. But Dan Thurot does it in Space-Biff.
