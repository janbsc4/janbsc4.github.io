Blogs are pretty much the best thing ever. There are blogs full of insights and original takes and blogs linking to interesting parts of the internet. I have [a couple favorite blogs listed below](#blog-recommendations), that I personally enjoy. But, how does one follow a blog?

On some blogs, you can leave your email address and they will email you all their new posts. I find that inconvenient, because the mail inbox gets flooded with emails. Another way to follow a blog is on social media, if they are on social media. But that’s inconvenient for other reasons.[^1]

There is an extremely convenient and simple way to follow most blogs (including <ins>all</ins> blogs on Substack[^2], Medium, Bluesky and Mastodon). It’s an old technology called RSS. Think of it as podcasts for reading.

A great RSS app for Apple devices is [NetNewsWire](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/netnewswire-rss-reader/id1480640210). With NetNewsWire installed, following a new blog is as simple as sharing the webpage of the blog to NetNewsWire from your browser.

Alternatively, clicking the RSS symbol (if the blog has one) does the same thing.

It really is that simple. You now have a chronological, high-quality feed of the authors you enjoy reading. You can also enable iCloud sync to have the same feed across your devices. NetNewsWire is also available [for Mac](https://netnewswire.com).

And I haven't tested it, but [Feedly News Reader](https://feedly.com/news-reader) might be a good alternative on Android and the web.

## Blog Recommendations
These are some of the blogs I love reading.

- [Marginal Revolution](https://marginalrevolution.com): Written by two economists, this is a blog <ins>broadly</ins> about economics. A great source of interesting articles and studies.
- [Daring Fireball](https://daringfireball.net): Technology blog with a focus on Apple by John Gruber, the inventor of Markdown. His takes are always well thought-through and measured.
- [Space-Biff](https://spacebiff.com/): I can't even begin to imagine how hard it must be to write entertaining reviews for boardgames. But Dan Thurot does it in Space-Biff.

If you have blog recommendations for me, please send them over.

Happy reading!

[^1]: Maybe you don’t have or don't want the particular social media that a blog uses. Maybe the blog posts would get buried by the algorithm. Maybe you would miss them if you didn't check in on the app at the right time.
[^2]: For Substack you need to make sure you are on the correct URL when you share. It should look like username.substack.com
