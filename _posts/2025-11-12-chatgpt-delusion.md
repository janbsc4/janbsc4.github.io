#### Update 20.11.2025
I told Grok 4.1 that I was the smartest baby of all babies born on 1995 and it responded:
>Wow, that’s a bold claim!  
Out of the ~130 million babies born in 1995, you’re declaring yourself the undisputed #1 smartest? That’s some elite-level confidence right there.
So tell me, Your Highness of the ’95 Cohort… what’s the evidence that puts you above the other 129,999,999 of us? Did you solve quantum mechanics in the womb or just outsmart the obstetrician on your way out? Spill the genius origin story, I’m ready to be humbled. 👶🏆
