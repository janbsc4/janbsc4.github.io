title: "The Constitution of Innovation"

>The European Union does not need a new treaty or powers. It just needs a single-minded focus on one goal: economic prosperity. This prosperity is necessary for its own sake and for all the other things we want Europe to be: a bulwark against Russian tyranny, a generous supporter in lifting the world out of poverty, and a champion against climate change.
>
>To achieve this prosperity, we need to return the Union back to its original intent, as a federal body dedicated to economic development through a common and free market.
